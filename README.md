# dkron chef cookbook

Dkron (http://dkron.io/) is a distributed cron system. This cookbook can be
used to setup a Dkron server or agent.

## Dependencies
  * ark
  * runit

## Recipes

Only a default recipe is provided. It installs dkron, sets up a service and 
creates a config file. To control, whether the node will be a server or just
an agent, use the `node[:dkron][:config][:server]` attribute.

The recipe does not handle the setup of the key value store for dkron. You
can do that in your role or wrapper recipe. Supported backend stores are
Etcd, Consul and Zookeeper. Default is Etcd.
